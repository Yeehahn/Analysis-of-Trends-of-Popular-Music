# IDP Final Project

Add instructions to explain the extended files & folders in your project. Also, if some/all of your project will not run from GitHub, provide instructions for how to setup and run your code locally. Ideally, only some parts of your project would require custom setup while the rest will run without changes.  

This file should be the starting point with enough directions and context that someone that has no idea what you have done or how to run your project, can get your code and work out how to view the documentation and run your project.
