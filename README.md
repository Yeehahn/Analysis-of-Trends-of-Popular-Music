# IDP Final Project
The goal of this project is to find how and why popular/hit music has changed over time and what characteristics are typical of popular music in each time period. There has also been a smaller goal of finding if there is any notable form of bias in the Grammy Awards process. To achieve this we have found data from Spotify and the Grammy Awards to illustrate popular music and have plotted and processed it. The flow of data is rather simple as it amounts to gathering the data collected by Spotify and the Grammys, cleaning and merging the data into new csv files, and then plotting the newly processed data.

# Explanation of Folders:


**raw_data:** Contains all raw data collected for this project. Reference raw_data's README to see sources.


**plots:** All plots that were created for this project. Plots is further separated into more folders representing each question that is responded to by the plots within the folder. For more details on what the questions are reference **Discovery Document.pdf**


**data_organized:** Contains all processed datasets that are prepared for graphing.


# Files:

**cse163_utils.py:** Pre made file with functions for testing


**run_tests.py:** Runs unit tests to make sure data is being processed correctly


**prepocess_data.py:** Pre-processes data to be used in plotting


**main.py:** Creates plots and saves as files


**Discovery Document.pdf:** Planning document with background information on the project


# Instructions 
Go to the desired file and click run. All libraries are created by standard
