# IDP Final Project


Add instructions to explain the extended files & folders in your project. Also, if some/all of your project will not run from GitHub, provide instructions for how to setup and run your code locally. Ideally, only some parts of your project would require custom setup while the rest will run without changes.  


This file should be the starting point with enough directions and context that someone that has no idea what you have done or how to run your project, can get your code and work out how to view the documentation and run your project.


**Explanation of Folders:**


**raw_data:** Contains all raw data collected for this project. Reference raw_data's README to see sources.


**plots:** All plots that were created for this project.


**data_organized:** Contains all processed datasets that are prepared for graphing.




**How To Run Code:**
All parts of this project should be able to run from GitHub. Just go to the desired file and hit run.
