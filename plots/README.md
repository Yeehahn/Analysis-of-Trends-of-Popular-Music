All of your generated plots need to be saved here. It should contain only images.


**question_1:** *These plots compare danceability but for the project plots will be created for all characteristics*


**Change in Danceability Over Time (Linear Regression):** This is a linear regression plot that compares one of the musical characteristics against time. This will help us look at changes in the characteristic over time and the line of best fit will help look at an overall trend. If we see a strong trend then we can confidently say how music has changed over time.


**Change in Danceability Over Time (Box and Whiskers):** This is a box and whiskers plot that compares one of the musical characteristics against time. This will help us look at changes in the characteristic over time and it will help us see where ranges for each decade are. The ranges will help see if popular music characteristics have begun to "converge" to a certain amount indicating a potential convergence of style of popular music.


**Change in Danceability in Popular Music VS. All Music (Box and Whiskers):** This is a box and whiskers plot that compares one of the musical characteristics against time. It plots both the popular music and music as a whole for each decade. This will help see if changes in popular music are different from changes in other music. It could also begin to help answer question 2 since differences in popular music and general music is shown.


**Change in Danceability in Popular Music VS. All Music (Line Plot):** This is a line plot that compares one of the musical characteristics against time. It plots both the popular music and music as a whole for each year. This will help see if changes in popular music are different from changes in music in general. It could also begin to help answer question 2 since differences in popular music and general music is shown.


**Change in Characteristics Over Time:** This is multiple line plots that plots all of the musical characteristics against time. This will help show what musical characteristics stayed constant over time and which ones changed. However, the main purpose of this plot is to summarize all previous plots.




**question_2:**


**Relative Feature Importance Predicting Hit Status** This is a bar chart that displays the relative importance of various musical characteristics, where relative importance displays how much having said characteristics influences music popularity. This will likely be obtained by a simple machine learning model.


**Characteristics in Popular Music:** This is a histogram/bar plot and summarizes all of the characteristics in each decade and their average values for popular music. The sketch displays data from 1990-2010 because more decades would create a cluttered plot and an "overload" of information. However, the final project will likely create plots to encompass 1920-2024. This will help show what musical characteristics will most likely be present to create popular music.


**Differences in Characteristics of Popular Music and All Music:** This is a histogram/bar plot and displays the average value of each characteristic for popular music subtracted by the average value of each characteristic for all music. This will display what is different between popular music and all music and that difference can help suggest what makes popular music popular, what the difference is.


**Traits VS. Popularity:** This is a line plot that compares all of the average musical characteristics against popularity. This will help display what characteristics are associated with popular music and will help create the next graph that displays mathematical information to suggest what music has a strong correlation with popularity.


**Strength of Correlation of Each Characteristic and Popularity:** This is a bar plot that displays all of the r^2 values for the correlation between a characteristic and popularity. The higher the r^2 value the stronger the correlation. The characteristics with a high r^2 value can suggest that those characteristics help make music popular.


**Violin Plot of Characteristics of Popular Music:** This is a violin plot that displays the values of each characteristic and the distributions of them. This will help display if popular music has tendencies to different extremes or values. For example, perhaps popular music is either extremely high in energy or extremely low, all other graphs would show that popular music has a medium amount of energy but this plot will help display the data at a deeper level. Ultimately helping answer what qualities of music make it popular.


**question_3:**


**Characteristics in Grammy Nominees and General Popular Music:** This is a violin plot of each characteristic and compares the values of grammy nominees and general popular music. This will help display the difference between grammy nominees and popular music and help answer what kind of music is associated with grammy nominees. Once again, since the violin plot displays the distribution of each value it will show greater detail of what characteristics are associated with grammy nominees.


**Percent of Grammy Nominees With a Strong Characteristic (Greater than 70):** This is a bar plot that displays each character and what percent of grammy nominees have a value greater than 70 for that characteristic. If a characteristic is often greater than 70, then that will show a commonality between grammy nominees and if a characteristic is more prevalent than others.


**question_4:**


**Artists With the Most Grammy Nominations:** This is a bar chart that displays the three artists with the most grammy nominations. For the final plot the number of artists does not necessarily need to be three, but for show of concept three is displayed. This can be used to see if there is an artist or artists with a stand out amount of nominations such that it could show bias.


**Artists With The Most Grammy Wins:** This is a bar chart that displays the three artists with the most grammy wins. For the final plot the number of artists does not necessarily need to be three, but for show of concept three is displayed. This can be used to see if there is an artist or artists with a stand out amount of wins such that it could show bias. It could also begin further research into if there is a bias in winning. If there is an artist with a lot of nominations but not a lot of wins, this could be an indicator of bias.


**Categories The Most Popular Artists Were Nominated For:** This could either be a swarm plot or a 2D dot plot with categorical data. This is a continuation of Artists With the Most Grammy Nominations. This will help show if there are any categories that are favored for an artist.


**Follower Count VS. Grammy Nominations:** This is a scatter plot that plots followers and number of grammy nominations. In the final plot the 3-5 artists with the most nominations will be highlighted and their name displayed in the key. This will help show if there are any artists that are being nominated very often even though their popularity may not reflect that. Once again suggesting potential bias.
