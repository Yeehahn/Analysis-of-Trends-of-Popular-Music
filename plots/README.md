All of your generated plots need to be saved here. It should contain only images.

**question_1:** *These plots compare danceability but for the project plots will be created for all characteristics*

**Change in Danceability Over Time (Linear Regression):** This is a linear regression plot that compares one of the musical characteristics against time. This will help us look at changes in the characteristic over time and the line of best fit will help look at an overall trend. If we see a strong trend then we can confidently say how music has changed over time.

**Change in Danceability Over Time (Box and Whiskers):** This is a box and whiskers plot that compares one of the musical characteristics against time. This will help us look at changes in the characteristic over time and it will help us see where ranges for each decade are. The ranges will help see if popular music characteristics have began to "converge" to a certain amount indicating a potential convergance of style of popular music.

**Change in Danceability in Popular Music VS. All Music (Box and Whiskers):** This is a box and whiskers plots that compares one of the musical characteristics against time. It plots both the popular music and music as a whole for each decade. This will help see if changes in popular music is different from changes in other music. It could also begin help answer question 2 since differences in popular music and general music is shown.

**Change in Danceability in Popular Music VS. All Music (Line Plot):** This is a line plot that compares one of the musical characteristics against time. It plots both the popular music and music as a whole for each year. This will help see if changes in popular music is different from changes in music in general. It could also begin help answer question 2 since differences in popular music and general music is shown.

**Change in Characteristics Over Time:** This is multiple line plots that plots all of the musical characteristics against time. This will help show what musical characteristics stayed constant over time and which ones changed. However, the main purpose of this plot is to summarize all previous plots. 


**question_2:**

**Characteristics in Popular Music:** This is a histogram/bar plot and summarizes all of the characteristics in each decade and their average values for popular music. The sketch displays data from 1990-2010 because more decades would create a cluttered plot and an "overload" of information. However, the final project will likely create plots to encompass 1920-2024. This will help show what musical characteristics will most likely be present to create popular music.

**Differences in Characteristics of Popular Music and All Music:** This is a histogram/bar plot and displays the average value of each characteristic for popular music subtracted by the avergae value of each characteristic for all music. This will display what is different between popular music and all music and that difference can help suggest what makes popular music popular, what the difference is.

**Traits VS. Popularity:** This is a line plot that compares all of the average musical characteristics against popularity. This will help display what characteristics are associated with popular music and will help create the next graph that displays mathematical information to suggest what music has a strong correlation with popuplarity.

**Strength of Correlation of Each Characteristic and Popularity:** This is a bar plot that displays all of the r^2 values for the correlation between a characteristic and popularity. The higher the r^2 value the stronger the correlation. The characteristics with a high r^2 value can suggest that those characteristics help make music popular.

**Violin Plot of Characteristics of Popular Music:** This is a violin plot that displays the values of each characteristic and the distributions of them. This will help display if popular music has tendencies to different extremes or values. For example, perhaps popular music is either in extremely high in energy or extremely low, all other graphs would show that popular music has a medium amount of energy but this plot will help display the data at a deeper level. Ultimately helping answer what quatlities of music make it popular. 

**question_3:**

**Characteristics in Grammy Nominees and General Popular Music:** This is a violin plot of each characteristic and compares the values of grammy nominees and general popular music. This will help display the difference between grammy nominees and popular music and help answer what kind of music is associated with grammy nominees. Once again, since the violin plot displays the distribution of each value it will show greater detail of what characteristics are associated with grammy nominees.

**Percent of Grammy Nominees With a Strong Characteristic (Greater than 70):** This is a bar plot that displays each character and what percent of grammy nominees have a value greater than 70 for that characteristic. If a characteristic is often greater than 70, then that will show a commonality between grammy nominees and if a characteristic is more prevalent than others.
